### Exploring the effects of first year cold-dormancy on the phenotypic, molecular and metabolic responses in head-started Gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus). ###

This repository contains data and code for estimating differences in: growth rate, telomere lenght, mitochondrial DNA density, and metabolic measures (glucose, acetyl CoA, triglycerides) between two treatments groups of head-started Gopher tortoises from Alabama, US.
