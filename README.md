### Exploring the effects of first year cold-dormancy on the phenotypic, molecular and metabolic responses in head-started Gopher tortoises (*Gopherus polyphemus*). ###

This repository contains data and code for estimating differences in: growth rate, telomere lenght, mitochondrial DNA density, and metabolic measures (glucose, acetyl CoA, triglycerides) between two groups of head-started Gopher tortoises from Alabama, US. The two treatment groups are: **constant-heat**, i.e. animals that were raised in constant greenhouse conditions for the whole study period of 11 months, and **cold-dormancy**, i.e. animals that experienced a period of simulated winter dormancy for ~2 months.
